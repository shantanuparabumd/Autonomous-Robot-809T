## Introduction

 The autonomous vehicle project aimed to navigate through obstacle courses while autonomously identifying and relocating colored objects within the environment. Leveraging Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04 to support ROS2 Galactic, the project integrated advanced technologies such as YOLO for object detection and MiDAS for depth estimation using a monocular camera. Encoders and IMU facilitated localization, while path planning was achieved through the RRT* algorithm for global navigation and potential field algorithm for dynamic path adjustments. Additionally, libraries were developed to interface Raspberry Pi hardware with C++ programs, involving UART, SPI, and I2C communication protocols for seamless integration within the Linux environment.
